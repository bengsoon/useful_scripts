# Useful Scripts

My personal collection of (hopefully) useful scripts. 

### Motivation
Many times, I have been required set up VMs/machines/workstations/dockers and I always wished I had saved them to scripts so that I did not need to look them up again. So here it is -- this is my attempt to _memorialize_ my work, so that I don't have to search them out again next time!

### Usage

To use them, you can either:
1. Copy-paste the code from the Github viewer directly
2. Git clone this repo
3. Download the scripts individually

Either way, if it is a bash script, make sure to set the permission:

``` shell
  chmod +x <file> # set permission
  
  ./<file> # run file
```


Please feel free to:
- Replicate them or re-use them as you see fit
- If you do use the scripts in any way commercial or publication, a little shoutout back to this Git repo will be very nice ;)
